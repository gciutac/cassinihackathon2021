# Cassini Hackathon 2021 - AnyDrop Project


Water is a quintessential component of life and predictions of water scarcity are to rise in the future. We propose a system that will help us save our water by more efficiently utilising it at the household stage while being able to monitor our surrounding areas for improvements.


# **The Problem:**

We believe that water is often misused and ultimately wasted in many households and thus goes back into our water management systems where it will have to be treated in order to be salvaged and then this resulting water is only usable in the agriculture domain, if it doesn’t reach an appropriate grade for watering crops then it is discharged into the ocean.

However, we believe that we should have the power in our household to be able to save water. For example, when we wash an apple or even the first few minutes in the shower before we start applying soaps, for most part this water isn’t heavily polluted with contaminants and we could save and reuse it by watering our gardens or local green areas.

# **Real-world Impact:**

Clean and drinkable water will undeniably be the next major resource that we will struggle to procure in the future and with global warming on the rise this will only become harder as time progresses.

Using our water more efficiently will give us the benefit of not having to compromise with water cuts and thus our green areas will continue to flourish. By employing smart systems in our households which have the capability to evaluate the water’s cleanliness and if satisfied then store it, will definitely make a positive impact because we alleviate the stress we put on our limited fresh water reservoirs without having to constantly rely on them for everything. This will be especially helpful to our green areas in the hot summer months when abnormally harsh dry spells can impose water cuts in order to further save and prolong our water supply.


# **Minimum Viable Product:**

We intend on making use of Arduinos and appropriate components, that will monitor the water coming into a household and after it has been used to be able to evaluate the quality of the water after usage while also being able to control the flow of the outgoing water which will either go into a water tank for storage for further use or if considered unsafe then it will flow as normally into the sewerage system.


# **Future Plans:**

After the Minimum Viable Product has been achieved there is a lot more work that can be put into this project to further enrich the process, monitoring and functionality.

A Flutter App can be developed which could allow the homeowner to override the control of water flow if required or be able to portray statistics to the homeowner concerning their water consumption, how much water they have saved or how contaminated their water becomes during the day based on the outgoing water’s metrics.

Overall monitoring can be seen by us, the admins, which could also be made publicly available, through a web portal which will run on a Spring MVC web app with a combination of Apache Spark or Tensorflow. We can evaluate our green areas over time by employing trained A.I. models to determine if they are healthier while also checking our water dams if they are conserving more water in proportion to that year’s rainfall.
